* Time flies

Go 1.6 is one year old (Happy Birthday!)

Go 1.7 is already 6 months old!

Go 1.8 was released on February 16th.

* Notes

The slides are available on [[https://talks.golang.org/2017/state-of-go.slide]]

Most of the code examples won't run except locally and using Go 1.8.

The playground still runs Go 1.7.

* Agenda

Changes since Go 1.7:

- The Language
- The Standard Library
- The Runtime
- The Tooling
- The Community

* Changes to the language

* Conversion rules

How many times have you found yourself with two types that were *almost* equal?

Let's say you define `Person`:

.code state-of-go/stdlib/json_old.go /type Person/,/^}/

And that for some reason, like JSON you also have:

.code state-of-go/stdlib/json_old.go /var aux/,/}/

* Conversion rules

In order to convert `aux` to type `Person` you needed to do:

.code state-of-go/stdlib/json_old.go /type Person/,/}/

    return Person{
        Name:     aux.Name,
        AgeYears: aux.AgeYears,
        SSN:      aux.SSN
    }

* Conversion rules

Since Go 1.8 you can simply do:

    return Person(aux)

Both types still need to have:

- same *sequence* of fields (the order matters)
- corresponding fields with same type.

* Conversion rules

A non-constant value x can be converted to type T in any of these cases:

- x is assignable to T.
- x's type and T have identical underlying types.
- x's type and T are unnamed pointer types and their pointer base types have identical underlying types.
- ...

* Conversion rules

A non-constant value x can be converted to type T in any of these cases:

- x is assignable to T.
- *ignoring*struct*tags*, x's type and T have identical underlying types.
- *ignoring*struct*tags*, x's type and T are unnamed pointer types and their pointer base types have identical underlying types.
- ...

* Ports to other platforms

* Ports to other platforms

32-bit MIPS

- big-endian (`linux/mips`)
- little-endian (`linux/mipsle`) - requires Floating Point Unit

Go on DragonFly BSD now requires DragonFly 4.4.4+.

Go on OpenBSD now requires OpenBSD 5.9+.

Plan 9 is now better!

* Ports to other platforms

Go 1.8 supports OS X 10.8+. Likely last time we support 10.8.

ARM:

- Go 1.8 is the last version to support ARMv5E and ARMv6 processors.

- Go 1.9 will require ARMv6K. Will it work on my platform?

    go tool dist -check-armv6k

* Tools

* Fix

Fixes the import path `"golang.org/x/net/context"` to `"context"`.

.code state-of-go/tools/gofix.go

Simply run the command below:

.play state-of-go/tools/gofix.sh /go tool/

Drop the `-diff` flag to rewrite the files.

* Vet

"Vet is stricter in some ways and looser where it previously caused false positives."

Example of extra check:

.play -edit state-of-go/tools/govet.go /func main/,

`govet` detects the problem statically:

.play state-of-go/tools/govet.sh /go vet/

* SSA everywhere!

The SSA backend:

- generates more compact and efficient code
- is a better platform for optimizations

For 32-bit ARM systems this means 20-30% speed up!

For others (where SSA was used already) gains are 0-10%.

* SSA everywhere

.image state-of-go/img/benchmark.png _ 800

* Default GOPATH

Yay!

When `GOPATH` is not defined, the tool will use:

- `$HOME/go` on Unix
- `%USERPROFILE%\go` on Windows

* go bug

Easier way to create bugs including all relevant information.

Example:

.play state-of-go/tools/gobug.sh /go bug/

* Runtime

* Detection of concurrent map accesses

Improvement on Go 1.6.

.play state-of-go/runtime/mapcrash.go /const/,/Wait\(\)/

Outputs:

	fatal error: concurrent map read and map write
	fatal error: concurrent map writes

* Mutex Contention Profiling

Profile your benchmarks and the contention on your mutexes.

    go test -bench=. -mutexprofile=mutex.out


Alternatively, activate contention profiling with this new method.

    runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction

_Note_: For now `sync.RWMutex` is not profiled.

* Mutex Contention Profiling

Let's write a program to count how many times each factor appears from 2 to N.

Example N = 10:

    Factorizations:

        2:  2
        3:  3
        4:  2 2
        5:  5
        6:  2 3
        7:  7
        8:  2 2 2
        9:  3 3
        10: 2 5

    Count:

        2: 8
        3: 4
        5: 2
        7: 1

* Mutex Contention Profiling

Which option is better?

Wide protected region:

.play state-of-go/runtime/mutex/main.go /WIDE/,/Unlock/

Narrow protected region:

.play state-of-go/runtime/mutex/main.go /NARROW/,/}/

* Changes to the standard library

* Sorting

Exercise:

Given a slice of `Person`

    var p []Person

Print the slice sorted by name, age, and SSN.

.code state-of-go/stdlib/sort/sort_test.go /sort.Sort/,/bySSN/

Easy, right?

* Sorting

Well, you forgot about this part.

.code state-of-go/stdlib/sort/sort_test.go /byName/,/bySSN\) Swap/

* sort.Slice

Since Go 1.8 you can simply write this:

.code state-of-go/stdlib/sort/sort_test.go /sort\.Slice/,/SSN/

Also new `SliceStable` and `SliceIsSorted`.

* Plugins

Define a plugin:

.code state-of-go/stdlib/plugin/plugin.go

Then build it:

    go build -buildmode=plugin

_Note_: This currently works only on Linux.

* Plugins

.code state-of-go/stdlib/plugin/main.go /plugin.Open/,/Hello/

* Plugins demo

Demo video: [[https://twitter.com/francesc/status/827851085943566336][twitter.com/francesc]]

Source code: [[https://github.com/campoy/golang-plugins][github.com/campoy/golang-plugins]]

* HTTP shutdown

Added `Shutdown` method to `http.Server`.

Example:

Call `Shutdown` when a signal is received:

.code state-of-go/stdlib/shutdown.go /subscribe/,/}\(\)/

* HTTP shutdown

Check why the server stopped.

.code state-of-go/stdlib/shutdown.go /HandleFunc/,/gracefully/


* HTTP/2

`http.Response` now satisfies the `http.Pusher` interface.

    type Pusher interface {
        Push(target string, opts *PushOptions) error
    }

A simple example:

.code state-of-go/stdlib/http2/http2.go /func rootHandler/,/^}/

* HTTP/2

.play state-of-go/stdlib/http2/http2.go /func main/,/^}/

HTTP: [[http://localhost:8080]]
HTTP/2: [[https://localhost:8081]]

* HTTP/2

* More context support

Since Go 1.7:

- net
- net/http
- os/exec

Since Go 1.8:

- http.Server.Shutdown
- database/sql
- net.Resolver
